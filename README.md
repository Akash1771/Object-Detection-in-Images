# Object-Detection-in-Images
Overview
    This project implements object detection in images using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm and OpenCV (cv2). YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection system that provides 
    accurate and fast detection of multiple objects in images.

Features
    Real-time object detection
    Support for multiple object classes
    Easy integration with OpenCV for image processing
    Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and labels

Requirements
    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    NumPy
    YOLOv3 weights and configuration files
